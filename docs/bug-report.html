                            <strong>URL:</strong> https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wireless+mouse<br>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>While testing product card information display (TC-007), an inconsistency was discovered where some products show delivery information directly on the search results page product cards, while others do not display this information until the user clicks "See All Buying Options".</p>

                <h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to https://www.amazon.com</li>
                    <li>Search for "wireless mouse"</li>
                    <li>Observe product cards on the search results page</li>
                    <li>Compare delivery information display across multiple products</li>
                    <li>Note that some products show delivery dates (e.g., "Delivery Dec 16-29") while others show "No featured offers available"</li>
                    <li>Click "See All Buying Options" on products without delivery info</li>
                    <li>Observe that delivery information IS available, but only shown after this additional click</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Expected Result</h3>
                <p>All product cards should consistently display delivery information on the search results page to allow users to easily compare delivery times when making purchase decisions. This is a critical factor for customer decision-making and should be presented uniformly across all products.</p>

                <h3>Actual Result</h3>
                <p>Delivery information display is inconsistent:<br>
                • Some products display delivery dates directly on product cards (e.g., "Delivery Wednesday, December 10")<br>
                • Other products show "No featured offers available" without delivery information<br>
                • Delivery information for the latter category is only revealed after clicking "See All Buying Options"
                </p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Impact:</strong> Users cannot easily compare delivery times across products without additional clicks. This creates friction in the shopping experience and may lead to suboptimal purchase decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Potential reduction in conversion rates due to increased cognitive load and extra steps required to access critical purchase information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Occurs consistently for products with multiple sellers or marketplace items (approximately 20-30% of search results)</li>
                    <li><strong>Workaround Available:</strong> Yes - users can click "See All Buying Options" to view delivery information, but this requires additional interaction</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Screenshots/Evidence</h3>
                <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>Screenshot 1: Product card WITH delivery information displayed</strong></p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><em>This product card displays delivery date directly: "Delivery Dec 16 - 29"</em></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Screenshot 2: Product card WITHOUT delivery information (requires clicking "See All Buying Options")</strong></p>
                    <img src="../screenshots/bug_1_screenshot2.png" alt="Product card missing delivery information" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><em>This product card shows "No featured offers available" and hides delivery information until user clicks "See All Buying Options"</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Suggested Fix</h3>
                <p>Display estimated delivery date for the default/featured offer on all product cards in search results. For products with multiple sellers, show delivery information for the default selected seller (e.g., Amazon.com or the Buy Box winner). This would maintain consistency with products that currently show delivery information.</p>

                <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
                <p>This appears to be more prevalent with products that have "No featured offers available" or multiple third-party sellers. Products sold and shipped by Amazon typically display delivery information consistently. The inconsistency may be intentional design for marketplace items, but from a UX perspective, it creates an inconsistent experience.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>When users select "Price: Low to High" from the sort dropdown on search results, they expect products to be displayed in strict ascending order based on the displayed price. However, the actual results show products out of order, with higher-priced items appearing before lower-priced items.</p>
                
                <p>This creates confusion and frustration for users who are trying to find the lowest-priced products, as they must manually scan through results rather than trusting the sort order.</p>

                <h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to Amazon.com</li>
                    <li>Search for "wireless mouse"</li>
                    <li>Wait for search results to load</li>
                    <li>Click on the "Sort by" dropdown</li>
                    <li>Select "Price: Low to High"</li>
                    <li>Wait for page to reload with sorted results</li>
                    <li>Observe the displayed prices of the first 10-15 products</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Expected Result</h3>
                <p>Products should be displayed in strict ascending order based on the displayed price. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product 1: $3.85</li>
                    <li>Product 2: $4.69</li>
                    <li>Product 3: $4.99</li>
                    <li>Product 4: $6.65</li>
                    <li>Product 5: $7.19</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each subsequent product should have a price greater than or equal to the previous product.</p>

                <h3>Actual Result</h3>
                <p>Products are displayed out of order. Example from actual test execution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product 1: $6.65</li>
                    <li>Product 2: $7.19</li>
                    <li>Product 3: $4.69</li>
                    <li>Product 4: $4.99</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Higher-priced items ($6.65, $7.19) appear before lower-priced items ($4.69, $4.99), violating the expected sort order.</p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Users cannot trust the sort functionality and must manually scan all results</li>
                    <li><strong>User Trust:</strong> Reduces confidence in Amazon's search and filtering capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Users waste time looking through unsorted results</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Users relying on screen readers or assistive technology may miss lower-priced items</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Users may abandon search and go to competitors with more reliable sorting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Evidence</h3>
                <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>Screenshot: Search results sorted by "Price: Low to High" showing incorrect order</strong></p>
                    <img src="../screenshots/bug_2_sort_issue.png" alt="Price sort showing products out of order" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <p><em>URL contains s=price-asc-rank parameter, confirming sort was applied, but products are not in ascending price order</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
                <p>Possible explanations for this behavior:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sponsored Products:</strong> Amazon may be prioritizing sponsored/promoted products regardless of price</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Algorithm:</strong> Sort may factor in total cost (price + shipping), Prime eligibility, seller reputation, or product relevance</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Decision:</strong> May be intentional to balance user experience with revenue from sponsored placements</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Suggested Fix</h3>
                <p><strong>Option 1 (Recommended):</strong> Implement strict price-based sorting that displays products in exact ascending order by displayed price. Sponsored products can still be marked as "Sponsored" but should respect the sort order.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> If sponsored products must appear out of order, clearly indicate this to users with messaging like: "Sponsored products may appear in different order" or visually separate sponsored items from organic results.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Rename the sort option to be more accurate, e.g., "Price: Low to High (with featured items)" to set proper expectations.</p>

                <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
                <p>This issue is classified as a <strong>Usability Issue</strong> rather than a functional bug, as the sort functionality technically works (URL parameter is applied), but the user-facing behavior does not match user expectations. This requires product/UX team review to determine if the current behavior is intentional and acceptable, or if it should be changed to improve user experience.</p>
                
                <p>Similar issues may exist with other sort options (Price: High to Low, Customer Reviews, etc.) and should be investigated.</p>
