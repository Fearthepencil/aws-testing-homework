                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>When users select "Price: Low to High" from the sort dropdown on search results, they expect products to be displayed in strict ascending order based on the displayed price. However, the actual results show products out of order, with higher-priced items appearing before lower-priced items.</p>
                
                <p>This creates confusion and frustration for users who are trying to find the lowest-priced products, as they must manually scan through results rather than trusting the sort order.</p>

                <h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to Amazon.com</li>
                    <li>Search for "wireless mouse"</li>
                    <li>Wait for search results to load</li>
                    <li>Click on the "Sort by" dropdown</li>
                    <li>Select "Price: Low to High"</li>
                    <li>Wait for page to reload with sorted results</li>
                    <li>Observe the displayed prices of the first 10-15 products</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Expected Result</h3>
                <p>Products should be displayed in strict ascending order based on the displayed price. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product 1: $3.85</li>
                    <li>Product 2: $4.69</li>
                    <li>Product 3: $4.99</li>
                    <li>Product 4: $6.65</li>
                    <li>Product 5: $7.19</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each subsequent product should have a price greater than or equal to the previous product.</p>

                <h3>Actual Result</h3>
                <p>Products are displayed out of order. Example from actual test execution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product 1: $6.65</li>
                    <li>Product 2: $7.19</li>
                    <li>Product 3: $4.69</li>
                    <li>Product 4: $4.99</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Higher-priced items ($6.65, $7.19) appear before lower-priced items ($4.69, $4.99), violating the expected sort order.</p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Users cannot trust the sort functionality and must manually scan all results</li>
                    <li><strong>User Trust:</strong> Reduces confidence in Amazon's search and filtering capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Users waste time looking through unsorted results</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Users relying on screen readers or assistive technology may miss lower-priced items</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Users may abandon search and go to competitors with more reliable sorting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Evidence</h3>
                <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>Screenshot: Search results sorted by "Price: Low to High" showing incorrect order</strong></p>
                    <img src="screenshots/bug_2_screenshot1.png" alt="Price sort showing products out of order" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <p><em>URL contains s=price-asc-rank parameter, confirming sort was applied, but products are not in ascending price order</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
                <p>Possible explanations for this behavior:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sponsored Products:</strong> Amazon may be prioritizing sponsored/promoted products regardless of price</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Algorithm:</strong> Sort may factor in total cost (price + shipping), Prime eligibility, seller reputation, or product relevance</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Decision:</strong> May be intentional to balance user experience with revenue from sponsored placements</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Suggested Fix</h3>
                <p><strong>Option 1 (Recommended):</strong> Implement strict price-based sorting that displays products in exact ascending order by displayed price. Sponsored products can still be marked as "Sponsored" but should respect the sort order.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> If sponsored products must appear out of order, clearly indicate this to users with messaging like: "Sponsored products may appear in different order" or visually separate sponsored items from organic results.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Rename the sort option to be more accurate, e.g., "Price: Low to High (with featured items)" to set proper expectations.</p>

                <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
                <p>This issue is classified as a <strong>Usability Issue</strong> rather than a functional bug, as the sort functionality technically works (URL parameter is applied), but the user-facing behavior does not match user expectations. This requires product/UX team review to determine if the current behavior is intentional and acceptable, or if it should be changed to improve user experience.</p>
                
                <p>Similar issues may exist with other sort options (Price: High to Low, Customer Reviews, etc.) and should be investigated.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>When users enter only special characters (e.g., !@#$%) into the search box, Amazon returns seemingly random, unrelated results (movies, books, etc.) instead of providing appropriate feedback about the invalid search input.</p>
                
                <p>This behavior may confuse users who accidentally type special characters or expect the system to validate their input and provide helpful guidance.</p>

                <h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to Amazon.com</li>
                    <li>Click on the search box</li>
                    <li>Enter only special characters: <code>!@#$%</code></li>
                    <li>Press Enter or click the search button</li>
                    <li>Observe the search results</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Expected Result</h3>
                <p>One of the following behaviors would be more user-friendly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Display "No results found" message with suggestion to try different search terms</li>
                    <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Show validation message: "Please enter valid search terms" or "Special characters only searches are not supported"</li>
                    <li><strong>Option 3:</strong> Strip special characters and show message: "Searching for: [empty]" with no results</li>
                    <li><strong>Option 4:</strong> Prevent search submission when only special characters are entered</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Actual Result</h3>
                <p>Amazon returns search results that appear to be unrelated to the special characters entered. Results include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Movies (Gen V, After The Hunt, Red One, The Mighty Nein, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Books (Unreasonable Hospitality)</li>
                    <li>TV Shows (Harlan Coben's Lazarus, Fallout, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The URL shows: <code>https://www.amazon.com/s?k=!@#$%</code></p>
                <p>No indication is given to the user that their search input was invalid or that results are unrelated to their query.</p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Confusion:</strong> Users may be confused why they're seeing unrelated results</li>
                    <li><strong>Wasted Time:</strong> Users may browse through irrelevant results before realizing their search was invalid</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Screen reader users may not understand why results don't match their input</li>
                    <li><strong>User Trust:</strong> May reduce confidence in search accuracy</li>

                <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
                <p>Possible explanations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Default Behavior:</strong> Amazon may be showing "popular items" or "trending content" when search input is invalid</li>
                    <li><strong>No Input Validation:</strong> Search system accepts any input without validation</li>
                    <li><strong>Fallback Logic:</strong> System may fall back to showing featured/promoted content when no matches are found</li>
                    <li><strong>Intentional Design:</strong> May be designed to always show results rather than empty pages</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Suggested Fix</h3>
                <p><strong>Option 1 (Recommended):</strong> Add input validation to detect searches containing only special characters and display a helpful message: "Your search contains only special characters. Please try searching with letters or numbers."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Show "No results found" message with search suggestions when only special characters are detected.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Strip special characters before searching and inform user: "Searching for: [empty]" with no results displayed.</p>

                <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
                <p>This is classified as a <strong>Low Severity</strong> usability issue because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's an edge case - most users don't search with only special characters</li>
                    <li>The system doesn't crash or cause errors</li>
                    <li>Users can easily correct their search</li>
                    <li>No data loss or security concerns</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>However, from a UX perspective, providing clear feedback about invalid input would improve the user experience and reduce confusion. This issue may also affect other special character combinations and should be tested comprehensively.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Related Testing:</strong> Should also test combinations like: <code>@@@</code>, <code>***</code>, <code>###</code>, mixed special characters with spaces, etc.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>When users apply a price range filter (e.g., $28 - $44) to search results, Amazon displays products whose <strong>current sale price</strong> falls outside the selected range, as long as the <strong>original/typical price</strong> is within the range.</p>
                
                <p>This creates inconsistency and confusion, as users expect to see products whose <strong>displayed price</strong> matches their filter criteria, not products with discounts that place them outside the range.</p>

                <h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to Amazon.com</li>
                    <li>Search for "phone case"</li>
                    <li>Wait for search results to load</li>
                    <li>In the left sidebar under "Price", set a range of $28 - $44</li>
                    <li>Click "Go" to apply the filter</li>
                    <li>Observe the displayed products and their prices</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Expected Result</h3>
                <p>All products displayed should have their <strong>current displayed price</strong> (including any discounts/sales) within the $28 - $44 range.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If filtered for $28-$44:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ Product with price $29.99 - SHOULD appear</li>
                    <li>✅ Product with price $35.00 - SHOULD appear</li>
                    <li>❌ Product with sale price $25.40 (even if original was $29.99) - SHOULD NOT appear</li>
                    <li>❌ Product with price $50.00 - SHOULD NOT appear</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Actual Result</h3>
                <p>Products with sale prices <strong>below</strong> the minimum filter threshold are displayed if their original price falls within the range.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Specific Example Found:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product:</strong> "for iPhone 16 Plus Case with 360° Rotatable Magnetic Ring Stand"</li>
                    <li><strong>Filter Applied:</strong> $28 - $44</li>
                    <li><strong>Current Price:</strong> $25.40 (with discount) ❌ <em>Below minimum of $28</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Original Price:</strong> $29.99 ✓ <em>Within range</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Product is displayed despite current price being outside the filter range</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Confusion:</strong> Users expect filtered results to match displayed prices, not original prices</li>
                    <li><strong>Filter Ineffectiveness:</strong> Price filters don't accurately narrow down results</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust Issues:</strong> Users may lose confidence in Amazon's filtering functionality</li>
                    <li><strong>Purchasing Decisions:</strong> Users might overlook better deals thinking they're outside their budget</li>
                    <li><strong>Inconsistent Logic:</strong> Unclear whether filtering is by current price or original price</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Evidence</h3>
                <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>Screenshot: Product with $25.40 sale price appearing in $28-$44 filter results</strong></p>

                    <p><em>Product shows $25.40 (below $28 minimum) but appears because "Typical price: $29.99" is within $28-$44 range</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
                <p>Possible explanations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Filter Logic:</strong> Price filter may be checking against original/list price rather than current displayed price</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Decision:</strong> Amazon may intentionally show discounted items to increase sales, even if outside user's filter</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Query:</strong> Backend query may filter by base price before applying discounts in the UI</li>
                    <li><strong>Inconsistent Handling:</strong> Sale prices may not be factored into filter logic</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Suggested Fix</h3>
                <p><strong>Option 1 (Recommended):</strong> Filter by <strong>displayed/current price</strong> including all discounts and sales. This matches user expectations - if a user filters for $28-$44, they want to see products that cost $28-$44 <em>right now</em>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> If filtering by original price is intentional, add clear indication: "Filtering by original price. Some items may show discounted prices." OR provide two filter options: "Current Price" and "Original Price".</p>
                
                <p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When a product's sale price falls outside the range, mark it clearly: "Outside your price range but on sale" with visual distinction.</p>

                <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
                <p>This is classified as a <strong>Medium Severity</strong> functional bug because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It directly affects search filtering functionality</li>
                    <li>It creates inconsistent user experience</li>
                    <li>It's not immediately obvious to users why certain products appear</li>
                    <li>It may cause users to miss better deals or make suboptimal purchasing decisions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Further Testing Needed:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test if products with sale prices <em>above</em> the maximum filter also appear (e.g., $50 sale price with $40 original in $28-$44 range)</li>
                    <li>Test behavior with "Up to $X" and other price filter options</li>
                    <li>Test across different product categories</li>
                    <li>Check if this behavior is documented anywhere in Amazon's UI</li>
                </ul>
